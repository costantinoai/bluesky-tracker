## Tips for Good Screenshots

1. **Use a clean browser** - No bookmarks bar, clean UI
2. **Decent screen resolution** - At least 1920x1080
3. **Full width** - Make browser window wide enough to show content properly
4. **Light mode** - Ensure good contrast and readability
5. **Real data** - Use your actual data (or blurred if needed for privacy)
6. **Compress** - Use tools like TinyPNG to reduce file sizes before committing

## Privacy

If you want to hide your actual usernames/handles:
- You can blur user handles in an image editor
- Or use browser dev tools to replace text before screenshotting
- Or just use the data as-is if you're comfortable

## After Taking Screenshots

1. Save them in `.github/screenshots/`
2. The README will automatically reference them
3. Commit and push the screenshot files
